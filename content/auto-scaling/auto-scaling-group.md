# Auto Scaling Group


The following Auto Scaling Group configuration sets :

* Minimum two instances to serve the traffic.
* Maxmum four instances to serve the traffic.
* Auto Scaling Group will be launched with 2 instances and put each of them in separate Availability Zones in different Subnets.
* Auto Scaling Group will get information about instance availability from the ELB.
* Make sure that Auto Sacling Group itself is just static configuration.  There is no rule when to add or remove instances.  
* Weâ€™re set up collection for some Cloud Watch metrics to monitor our Auto Scaling Group state. (Covered in Auto Scaling Policy section)
